Welcome to the IW4x Wiki!
=========================

**IW4x** is a modification of the game **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
2**, developed by **Infinity Ward**.

The goal of this modification is to finish the - in our eyes -
unfinished development of the PC version of **Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare 2**, like other projects (e.g. **alterIWNet** and
**fourDeltaOne**) did in the past.

Core features
-------------

-  rewritten from scratch
-  decentralized backend
-  dedicated servers (party and match mode)
-  mod support, includes an integrated zonebuilder to build your own
   fastfiles (e.g. a *mod.ff*)
-  improved user interface
-  theater mode
-  support for leaning
-  offline playable lan mode
-  **and much more...**
